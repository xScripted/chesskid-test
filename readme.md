# ![Logo](./client/src/assets/logo.png) Front-end Technical Test - _Miquel Toran_

To run the client: `npm run serve`

## Tech

- **Vue 3** using <script setup> new feature
- **Typescript**
- **Vuex**
- **Vue-router**
- **Jest**
- **Sass**
- **Icons** Free svg icons from: https://heroicons.dev

## Features

I decided to make the app as much scalable as possible and easy to mantain.

- The main sass variables are in a global scss (assets/scss)
- Store separated in modules
- Typescript in all components and store
- Comments in the important parts

I have chosen to do the pagination by myself in order to have full control over it.

About the Friend Details Page's design I decided to follow the patterns of the Main Design to make all the project more cohesive
